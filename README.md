## Overview

This README covers:

- **What** a Mongoose schema is.  
- **How** to define and export a `User` model.  
- **Why** common options and methods are used.  
- A list of **interview questions** (questions only).

## Installation

```bash
npm install mongoose
Usage
Import Mongoose:

js
Copy
Edit
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
Define your schema (see Schema Definition).

Export the model:

js
Copy
Edit
export const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Use it in your code:

js
Copy
Edit
import { User } from './models/User.js';
// e.g., const newUser = await User.create({ username, email, password });
Schema Definition
js
Copy
Edit
import mongoose from 'mongoose';

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    username: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      lowercase: true,
      unique: true
    },
    email: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
      lowercase: true,
      unique: true
    },
    password: {
      type: String,
      required: [true, 'Password is required']
    }
  },
  {
    timestamps: true // adds createdAt and updatedAt
  }
);

export const User = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
Field Options Explained
type: Specifies the JavaScript type (e.g., String, Number).

required: Ensures the field must be provided; can include a custom error message.

lowercase: Converts string input to lowercase before saving.

unique: Creates a unique index to prevent duplicates (note: not full validation).

timestamps: Schema option that auto-creates createdAt and updatedAt fields.

Why These Patterns?
new mongoose.Schema(): Initializes a schema instance with fields and options.

Automatic Pluralization: mongoose.model('User', ...) stores documents in the users collection (lowercased, pluralized).

Validation & Indexing: Combining validation (required) and indexing (unique) helps enforce data integrity.

Timestamps: Simplifies tracking document creation and updates without manual fields.
